Give the images diferent sizes and diferent number of images in each row. 

1. Aplly basic styles to the images
- see the images
- we are going to point to the images-row div 
- give some height, bg-repate, bg-size, bg-position
- We are going to put a litle of a white border around all the images 

2. Define flexbox properties
- create a .image-row with a display: flex; - everything is going to disapear because don't have width.
- in the first 3 images that are going to be together we set flex: 1; after the bg-image in each one.
- for diferent sizes we set a diferent number to the ones we want
- do the same in the all rows with diferent flex to make a litle messy.

3. Create a media query to allows us to see the images
- define the flex-direction to column
