1. Build a simple image grid with flexbox using background images.

p.s. all images are 350px width

1. Step apply some styles to the images
- first we are going to apply some styles to the div inside the image-grid.
- the image will take 1/4 of the with or 25%
- set the bg-repeat, bg-size, bg-position
- get rid of the margins on the html and body

2. Apply flexbox rules
- in the container display: flex; - display all images to one row
- use the propery flex-wrap: wrap;
- with smaller browers we need to add media queries
- here we point the flex direction to column, and the flex-wrap to no-wrap
- another rule to .image-grid div with the width to 100%
