Use flexbox to layout an entire page.

Will consiste in two columns with the same height.

Steps:
------

1. Which item will be the flexbox container?
- the parent is the div with the class of container
- set in css display: flex;

2. To resize the columns. Make the first column twice larger then the second column:
- the flex property allows us to use an arbitrary number system to determin the widths
- if we set the the first column set to 2 and the second set to 1 makes the first column twice the width of the second column.
- in css on the .main-content set the flex: 3; (in this case)
- in css on the .sidebar set the flex: 1; (in this case)
- the columns will now have the same height

3. How can we nest flexbox containers in our layout?
- to fill all the size of the second column
- we make the sidebar a container - display: flex;
- make the flex-direction: column;
- make the justify-content: space-between;
